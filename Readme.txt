I assume that I am creating a global application.
I assume that the configurability of policies is about allowing value changes, rather than changing parameters within the policy itself.
I assume that one policy will be used per one request.I assume that only one policy can be applied at a time.
I assume that the request to calculate the price will include/require quantities, product IDs, and the policy ID.
I assume that the calculation endpoint will be hit when the shopping cart is being summed up â€”just before the payment step. This scope does not include the calculation of current prices displayed on the UI.
